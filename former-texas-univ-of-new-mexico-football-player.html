His family posted a statement on social media on Sunday expressing their concern for his safety because they hadn’t been able to reach him since Thursday.</p><p>It’s such heartbreaking and awful news to hear of Jaden’s demise, said Texas coach Steve Sarkisian in a statement. He was a wonderful person, and we all enjoyed being around him, coaching him, and just hanging out.</p><p>“All of our thoughts are with his family, friends, and teammates,” he continued, “and we want to send our deepest condolences to them in such a difficult time.” The cause of death is still a mystery.</p><h3>More About Jayden Hullaby</h3><p>LIVING THROUGH YOU BIG BRUDDA FOREVER I SWEAR I GOT YOU AND THE FAMILY FOREVER AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, GET YOUR REST KING.
