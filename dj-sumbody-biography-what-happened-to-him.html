He was born in Pretoria but was originally from Apel Cross in Limpopo. Even though he died at a young age, DJ Sumbody is considered one of the pioneers of the amapiano kwaito genre. Not only did he release many smash hits in the music genre, but produced some as a record producer.</p><h2><strong>DJ Sumbody’s Parents</strong></h2><p>While alive, DJ Sumbody was very close to his mother, who is a teacher. His late father worked in the transportation industry and owned a few taxis. After his father’s demise, Oupa had to ensure that his mother and two younger siblings, named Thandiwe and Koketso Sefoka, were well taken care of. Despite his busy engagements, he made sure to visit his family frequently at their place of residence in Danville, Pretoria West.</p><p>Once in a while, he shared posts about his family members. And in August 2022, he <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">celebrated</a> his mother’s 60th birthday and shared a video on Instagram where both were seen dancing and looking very excited. In the caption he gave to the post, he disclosed that his mother taught him various life lessons, including staying humble and never letting people know about his plans.</p><h2><strong>DJ Sumbody Kicked Off His Career In The University</strong></h2><p>Following his high school graduation, DJ Sumbody enrolled at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Tshwane University of Technology</a>. After two years of study, he decided to drop out of the university to focus on his music career.</p><p>Before then, he had <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">worked</a> as a volunteer producer and presenter on a show called, Mashaedi on the Engage on TUT FM.</p><p>During such time, the Limpopo artist also put to a start his career as an events promoter. In 2007, he promoted the Metal Shutdown event hosted at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pretoria</a> Showgrounds. It was attended by more than 3,000 students from the Tshwane University of Technology and other higher institutions.</p><h2><strong>He Went From a Taxi Driver to a Famous Artist and DJ</strong></h2><p>In an attempt to finance his burgeoning music career, DJ Sumbody <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">drove</a> his father’s taxis part-time. After saving enough money, he purchased vinyl records at Exquisite Joint, a record store owned by prominent DJ and broadcaster Glen Lewis. Subsequently, he started his disc jockeying career and was performing at weddings, birthday parties, and music events.</p><p>He also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">had</a> gigs on a number of radio and TV stations, including MTV Base and Channel O. As a producer, Oupa Sefoka produced two compilation albums – ‘Larger Than House Vol 1’ and ‘Larger Than House Vol 2’. He released the albums in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Eventually, he had his career breakthrough in the year 2017 when he collaborated with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>DJ Tira</a>, Emza, and Thebe to release the hit song, ‘Ayepyep’.</p><p>DJ Sumbody was quite famous for coming up with the word, ‘Ayepyep’. It was the response he usually gave when gqom artists would repeat the phrase, ‘wololo’ along with their audience. It eventually became a trademark to him as an artist, and the catchphrase also became synonymous with Pitori nightlife. In 2018, the late DJ collaborated with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Cassper Nyovest</a> to drop ‘Monate Mpolaye’ and ‘Remote Control’.</p><p>The former was certified 3x platinum by the Recording Industry of South Africa, and its YouTube video gained over three million views. In the following year, DJ Sumbody released his studio album titled ‘Ashi Nthwela’, and singles from the album were playlisted on several radio stations.

In 2016, he, alongside his longtime friend cum business partner, Kagiso Setsetse, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">founded</a> Ayepyep Lifestyle Lounge. The two purchased Café del Khuze in Sunnyside and renamed it Ayepyep Lifestyle Lounge. Prior to his death, Sefoka had hosted numerous music events at the lounge, which operates as a restaurant during the day and a club at night.</p><p>More so, the multi-talented artist was the founder and owner of a record label called Sumsound Productions. In June 2020, he <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">signed</a> a partnership deal with Sony Music Entertainment Africa. Interestingly, the deal was not only intended to progress DJ Sumbody’s career but also develop the up-and-coming artists signed to the label. And they include Snow Deep, Madam MC, and The Lowkeys.</p><p>Furthermore, the record producer was reportedly a co-founder of his family transport business―Jamoloto & Son Transport Company.</p><h2><strong>DJ Sumbody’s Death</strong></h2><p>DJ Sumbody died on Sunday, November 20th, 2022, in the morning of the day for his big annual music event known as DJ Sumbody All White Veuve Clicquot Picnic. As an amapiano pioneer, DJ Sumbody hosted many annual music events in the country. He kicked off the Sunnyside Block Beach Party in 2013 and hosted it for nine years.</p><p>Then in November 2022, he began counting down to the popular annual all-white picnic on social media, describing how huge it was going to be.
