His portrayal of Anthony won him several awards, including ‘Best Dramatic Performance’ at the 2002 British Soap Awards.</p><p>Ray later became more widely known after appearing on series three of the X Factor in 2006. He went all the way to the final and eventually became runner-up to Leona Lewis. His debut album ‘Doing It My Way’ entered the UK album charts at number one, and sold over 300,000 copies – all without releasing a single.</p><p>Since then, he competed on the 2009 series of Dancing on Ice, and went on to win the final. He was later invited back to the show in 2014 to take part in the final series of Dancing on Ice. He was crowned the Champion of Champions, beating Hayley Tamaddon and Beth Tweddle to win the title.</p><p>Ray has&nbsp;also starred in numerous West End shows, including Grease, Dirty Dancing and&nbsp;Legally Blonde. Most recently, he shared another talent with the nation, in the form of impressions on ITV’s Get Your Act Together. Mentored by Debra Stephenson, Ray’s hilariously accurate impressions won him the show.</p><p>In terms of music, Ray has been busy in the studio working with a team of songwriters and producers to create an album of original songs for his&nbsp;eagerly awaited second album. With the album in the pipeline,&nbsp;Ray is&nbsp;about to hit the road with his ‘No Man’s Land’ tour which will give fans a preview of his new sound.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/exclusive-interview-with-ray-quinn-02.jpg alt="Ray Quinn" width=605 height=908 sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ahead of the tour, we caught up with Ray to chat about what fans can expect to hear from him, his career highlights so far, and whether or not the jack-of-all-trades is hiding any more secret talents!</p><p><strong>Hi&nbsp;Ray! First off, how are you keeping?</strong></p><p>Very good indeed thanks!</p><p><strong>You’re about to head off on your ‘No Man’s Land’ tour. What can fans expect from your show?</strong></p><p>I’m very excited to be going off on tour. They can expect to exclusively hear my brand new material off the new album, also some covers that I’ve chosen to compliment the original music. Along with a stripped back ‘tip of the hat’ style to the swing music where it all began for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the best and worst thing about touring for you?</strong></p><p>Best thing I guess is seeing the different cities and towns I love, and performing the music that means so much to me. Worst thing? Not being able to go to the&nbsp;gym!</p><p><strong>How do you like to prepare for a show? Do you have any rituals before you go on stage?</strong></p><p>I have my hot water with lemon.., then warm up my vocals as every artist would. But I guess hearing the audience settling in to the auditorium is my favourite bit.</p><p><strong>You’ll be taking in all corners of the UK – do you have a favourite town/city to perform at?</strong></p><p>Well obviously I’m biased when it comes to my own town. However, all the venues on my tour dates I’ve chosen as I’ve gigged there before and I’ve never not had fun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We know you’re a big fitness fan – how do you keep fit whilst on the road?</strong></p><p>I run a lot with my Nike app&nbsp;or find a local gym to satisfy my urge to work out. But I find eating healthy foods can sustain what it is you work hard for in the gym. You are what you eat as they say.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/exclusive-interview-with-ray-quinn-03-683x1024.jpg alt="Ray Quinn" width=673 height=1009 sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>You’ve been working hard in the studio on your second album. What can we expect to hear from your original material?</strong></p><p>It’s mainly pop, with one ballad in there, but also fun, happy songs too. The album itself takes all different dips and turns to reflect my journey in not only my personal life but also from a career sense over the last two&nbsp;years. I wanted the album to be the best representation of me from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Your debut album was swing/jazz orientated. How has your musical style evolved over the years?</strong></p><p>People change constantly. Their influences change, their views change, so I&nbsp;needed to find a sound that marks me as an artist. So when you hear it, it’s instantly recognisable. Music also has evolved dramatically so what I listened to then isn’t necessarily what I listen to now. Bringing all that together, you have my album. I couldn’t be more excited for my fans to hear it.</p><p><strong>As well as being a singer, you’re known for being an actor and theatre performer with numerous credits to your name. What would be your dream musical role?</strong></p><p>My dream musical role would have to be…Tony Monero in Saturday Night Fever. It was the first musical I witnessed so it’s always been a goal for me. Maybe one day!</p><p><strong>You’ve also tackled ice skating and impressions on reality tv shows – are you hiding any more secret talents?</strong></p><p>Haha.. I dunno really, when I’m put on the spot and I’m under pressure I always do my best to deliver.. it’s just how I work. I didn’t for one second though think I’d end up doing these things but I enjoyed every single minute.&nbsp;</p><p>https://youtu.be/4p5btICymCI</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved a huge amount during your incredible career – what would you say is your biggest career highlight so far?</strong></p><p>I’d say it was coming back for a second year on Dancing On Ice Champion of Champions. There was a hell of a lot of pressure there for me to deliver. Not only for myself but from those around me at the time. I just needed to prove I could do it. So when myself and Maria won I was over the moon, I think my reaction was obvious!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?</strong></p><p>My dad is my best mate and he’s always said, ”Fail to prepare…Prepare to fail’ so I’ve never done anything without giving it my full attention. It’s not let me down yet.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finally, do you have a message for your supporters?</strong><br><br>I’d just like to say I guess.. a&nbsp;huge thank you for showing me the love and support you have over the last however many years of my career. And please continue to do this as the journey ahead for me is so exciting and means the world to me. I appreciate every one of you guys… Big BIG love!!!</p><h4>Thank you to Ray Quinn for his time!</h4><h4>You can catch him on his ‘No Man’s Land’ tour throughout September to November.
