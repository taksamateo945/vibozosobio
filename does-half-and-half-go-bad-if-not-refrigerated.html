According to Cornell University, when a product is ultra-pasteurized, it’s heated to a minimum of 280 degrees Fahrenheit, and it stays at that temp for <b>at least two seconds</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_temperature_should_half-and-half_be_stored_at></span>What temperature should half-and-half be stored at?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>between 40 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_happens_if_you_drink_spoiled_half_and_half></span>What happens if you drink spoiled half and half?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>However, even if you can get past the unpleasant taste, drinking spoiled milk isn’t a good idea.

A small sip of spoiled milk <b>is unlikely to cause symptoms beyond a bad taste.

Half and half can last around three to five days past its due date unopened, and seven to ten days after opening if you’re using a large container. The small cups of half and half last longer because they’ve been sterilized and sealed off; they can survive at least a month past the “best by” date.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_can_half_and_half_be_unrefrigerated></span>How long can half and half be unrefrigerated?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Half and half should be stored in a refrigerator like all dairy products such as buttermilk.

It’s best to store the dairy creamer in the refrigerator at 40-Degree Fahrenheit temperature. If you want to store creamer for a long time, it’s a good idea to go with the powdered form.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_store_half-and-half></span>How do you store half-and-half?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like milk, cream and half-and-half last the longest in a cool spot in <b>the fridge. Avoid the door! The door is for condiments.

If it has a sour smell, it most definitely is time for it to be discarded. Spoiled half and half will also have a <b>curdled appearance and its texture will not be smooth.</b></p><p class=dpsp-share-text>Share this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidkam2r7PEsaeiqpWZe6S7zGibqJ2jYrWiuMVmmKecXZ2urbKMoKZmmpGZeqqyjKemrWWimrOztcaeqZqslZl8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html&text=Does%20half%20and%20half%20go%20bad%20if%20not%20refrigerated%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html&title=Does%20half%20and%20half%20go%20bad%20if%20not%20refrigerated%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html&title=Does%20half%20and%20half%20go%20bad%20if%20not%20refrigerated%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html&title=Does%20half%20and%20half%20go%20bad%20if%20not%20refrigerated%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-half-and-half-go-bad-if-not-refrigerated.html&description=Does%20half%20and%20half%20go%20bad%20if%20not%20refrigerated%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./176013-ntsiki-mazwai-questions-difference-president-jacob-zumas-mk-party-anc.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ntsiki Mazwai Questions the Difference Between Former President Jacob Zumas MK Party and ANC">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-hailee-steinfelds-snapchat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Hailee Steinfeld's Snapchat?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
