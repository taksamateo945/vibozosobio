The anime characters-with-black-hair are not only characterized by their excellent abilities but also by their tough hearts. The majority of anime characters have black hair. Such characters can be found in various genres and storylines, hailing from manga to television series. The list below represents the top 20 best anime characters with black hair, as ranked by fans across the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all characters on the list are <a href=#>villains</a>, but it should be noted that anime is notorious for its interesting villains. Even though there are a lot of anime characters with black hair, they do vary in personality. But here are the Top 20 of the best black-haired anime characters. We encourage everyone to comment on the character they like and if you notice any that we missed!</p><p>So, let’s round up to the top 20 anime characters with black hair to provide some serious style inspiration.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>20. Saizou Kirigakure (Brave 10)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/saizou-kirigakure.jpg><p>Saizou comes in at number 20 as being one of the best Anime Boys with black hair! He has blue-toned black hair. In Brave 10 Anime series, he’s an assassination expert on his big kunai called “Marie blade.” He is a little lonely and refuses to serve as his master any lord and hates Koga Ninja with a revolting passion. His life as a lone wolf is interrupted by a loosely-dressed priestess running out of the killers. The black hair of Saizou is a bit bushy; although it is somewhat neater on the front, the sides of the hair are unclear, and there are small locks on all sides.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>19. Hak Son (Akatsuki no Yona)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hak-son.jpg><p>Our next anime boy with hairs, Hak, looks like Saizou with an ‘icy cool’ attitude, but the difference here is the length of the story to the main woman. Since they were kids, Hak was friends with Princess Yona. He loves Yona, and Hak flees with her and is in charge when her father is killed by Su-won, their younger friend who also had loved Yona. His personality is very charming as his hair is blue-black hued with a less cool, disorderly look. It stretches beyond his ears and always looks darker when he’s angry or more playful when he’s comical. His hair is like every good bishop and pairs with him nicely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>18. Rin Okumura (Ao no Exorcist-Blue Exorcist)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rin-okumura.jpg><p>Rin Okumura is one of our favorite anime boys with black hairs from Ao no Exorcist anime. He was a normal guy 15 years old, who one day finds out that he is Satan’s son, Gehenna’s lord, and has unleashed his demonic power. His brother, Yukio, already knew and trained to be an exorcist. Rin did not wish to join his father in governing Gehenna. Therefore he also began training as an exorcist. Ao No Exorcist rightly has a blue subject, so Rin’s flames are blue, with black hair and blue eyes. His hair is not very remarkable, but it is highly intentional.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>17. Monkey D. Luffy (One Piece)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/monkey-d-luffy.jpg><p>One Piece is one of Japan’s longest-running anime, and Luffy is far from Japan’s <a href=#>best-known characters </a>of all time. Life’s blackest hair is in this list, and it’s always seen with a <a href=#>yellow</a>, straw, striped red, with no usual shadows or highlights because of its simple animation style. This black-haired anime boy has long hair with messy locks, but a few strands hug the rim if he is wearing his chape. It’s a pretty boyish haircut, not particularly beautiful, but it has a lot of charm. Under his right eye is a scar, and his iconic pirate’s clothing is certainly worthy of the sand and has an X scar on his chest.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>16. Mei Misaki (Another)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mei-misaki.jpg><p>Mei Misaki is the next black-haired anime character with exceptional qualities from Another <a href=#>manga series</a>. In many ways, Mei Misaki reminds me of myself. She has this “aura” and is observant, reserved, and makes you curious about her. Despite all our best efforts to make friends or to establish relationships, she believes everybody is alone. And she’s not depressed because of that. It’s just like she sees the world because she tends to look at things like what they are (logically) instead of feeling like it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>15. Kurome (Akame Ga Kill)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kurome.jpg><p>Kurome is the type of girl who is at the wrong time and in the wrong place. With her sister. Born as a black-haired <a href=#>anime girl</a> in Akame Ga Kill anime, she is intended as a murderer for a <a href=#>lifetime</a>. She is an old member of the Jaegers and the more youthful sister of Akame. Sold by her parents to the Kingdom along with Akame, the sisters were raised as assassins. She was conscripted into a different assassin association than her sister, and the brothers and sisters parted ways. However, She is greedy, cold, insecure, ruthless, fun-loving, vengeful, and psychotic.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>&nbsp;14. Sasuke Uchiha (Naruto)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sasuke-uchicha.jpg><p>Moving on to our next best Anime Boy with <a href=#>black </a>hair is Sasuke. He was the first crush of everybody in Naruto. Ever hearing of anime, anyone probably has seen a picture of him, but he grew up a lot in this series, starting with being a little girl and enduring a fighting veteran. The black hair of Sasuke frames his face and short back spikes. The hair on his face points straight down like fangs while the hair in the back hangs out, almost like a cat licking his head! He has Black eyes and usually wears some blue/gray <a href=#>clothes </a>in his most infamous anime, Naruto.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>13. Levi (Shingeki no Kyojin -Attack on Titan)</h2><p>When Titans almost brought humanity to extinction centuries ago, humanity started building walls to protect them by our next best Anime Boy with black hairs named Levi. And for one hundred years, no Titan came to his place until a colossal Titan appeared and broke the wall. The people in Wall Maria have fled further inside, and the <a href=#>battle </a>is beginning to take back what is. As the best and strongest soldier in humanity, Levi has a very strong fan base. His iconic haircut, popular in Japan, has rasped sides and black locks that pass through his ears. His hair is always so slightly divided on his side and only goes to his eyes. It is nearly like a well-made but attractive bowl.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>12. Hana Isuzu (Girls Und Panzer)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hana-isuzu.jpg><p>You don’t have to be a fan of the Girls Und Panzer anime character Hana Isuzu with black hair to love this adorable and fun wallpaper. It shows her soft side as she relaxes with her teddy bear and pillow after a long day at school. Her sweet face and the pale yellow tones of her room add to the storybook quality of this image. She has “lazy eyes,” which make her feel tired or sleepy. She has a fairly equilibrated role for the main team in the series. That’s contrary to what you’d expect if Hana’s soft and gentle character were judged.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Akame (Akame Ga Kill)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/akame.jpg><p>Akame is the main character in the <a href=#>Japanese anime series</a> Akame Ga Kill and one of our favorite choices of anime-character-with-black-hairs! She is a young member of the assassination group Night Raid, who specializes in short-range combat. A fairly stoic girl, she often keeps her emotions and thoughts hidden behind a blank expression, making it somewhat difficult to tell what she is thinking or feeling. The personality of Akame is aloof, indifferent, and cold. This is also why she has the will to fight a revolution and bring it about.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Inkarmat (Golden Kamuy)</h2><p>A beautiful woman with Ainu clothes, Inkarmat from the Golden Kamuy series has more adorable black hairs, making her rank on number ten on this list. She is created from a race of people who died in the history of Japan. Her look speaks for herself. The way her hair, clothing, work as a lucky person, and how she fits into the story are all about her. The actress’s voice is as gentle as she comes, reflecting the personality and style of Inkarmat. It does not turn out that good before believing that we have never seen such a supporting character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Sebastian Michaelis (Kuroshitsuji -Black Butler)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sebastian-michaelis.jpg><p>Sebastian Michaelis is our next most popular black-haired anime boy from Kuroshitsuji -Black Butler manga series. You often see him in a black suit to boot with his well-organized black hairs. His suit is from the Victorian era, as the series is set there, but it is always so slightly visual. His hair is a popular visual kei cut and made girls swoon around the world. He has a big strand tucked behind his ears, down in the center of his face, and a pair on his side.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Vegeta (Dragonball Z)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vegeta.jpg><p>Vegeta is an iconic anime guy with black hair who can be found throughout the world. Though he began as a villain in DBZ early on, he was an ally that married Bulma and helped protect the earth in countless struggles. He is a Saiyan, with his Goku, whom he speaks as Kakarot, the name Saiyan Goku. He is Saiyan and Saiyajin. Vegeta’s hair takes the cake for volume, with numerous large peaks that stick straight up, similar to fire itself. His hair is jet black, and there are no highlights. In Dragonball GT, Vegeta has a wild make-up that is almost like Mr. Satan. He randomly cut off his hair and used to change his hairstyles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Hitomi Mishima (Hinamatsuri)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hitomi-mishima.jpg><p>Our next anime girl with black hair is Hitomi Mishima from the Hinamatsuri series. She is a character of polarisation. In the beginning, she finds himself in Hinamatsuri with this nice, innocent, pure heart. The girl who focuses on learning and caring for her own business. Comedy on the side is a little bit like Hitomi, who speaks behind his back about people. And after a high-paying job as a bartender, she becomes arrogant. But her character features are good. And the reality is – We never saw a character “feel” like Hitomi’s main character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Shana (Shakugan No Shana)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shana.jpg><p>Shana, a black-haired anime girl, belongs to the Shakugan No Shana anime series. When Shana is chilled, relaxed, and devoid of duty, her black hair touches her shoulder. She is one of the most “original” types of characters of Shakugan No Shana. Shana is a bit rude and irritable, only to warm up later. For her age, she is even more disciplined and mature than most older people. She has skills like a master in a battle swordsman, which makes you adore her even more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Roy Mustang (Fullmetal Alchemist)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/roy-mustang.jpg><p>Roy isn’t unusual to be on popular lists but still, everyone adores his black hairs. So, this anime guy with black hair is cool, and he’s a man with a good heart. He wept when Maes Hughes tragically passed away and left him alone to climb the ladder. He secretly wants to be a ferry, and he wants to change the reverse system. He is in charge of Edward in the Fullmetal Alchemist series. His hair is turbojet black with grey eyes that match his personality. His hair is like a porcupine, facing down all the quills, and is quite short in the army but much longer than usual.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Rin Tohsaka (Fate Stay Night)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rin-tohsaka.jpg><p>Another black hair anime girl is Rin Tohsaka from the Fate Stay Night anime series. Even she has more “touches” and manners than most tropics Tsundere. She could be angry at stupid things, such as Shiro does not admit her “indirect” hints. But what makes Rin Tohsaka likable is that she has her independence, drive, and strong thinking. And she’s too proud to accept things she’s distracted by. She is a girl, far from being a maid in distress, who could take care of herself!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. L (Death Note)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/l-death-note.jpg><p>L, who has many names, is the biggest <a href=#>detective </a>in the world and the most eccentric person in the world in his most infamous anime, Death Note. This anime guy with black hair is most famous and iconic. L tops are the most popular character charts by a wide margin. He goes against Master Light, whose Death Note is received and can kill anyone with a name and knowledge of his face. He is a star <a href=#>tennis player</a> who won the UK Junior Cup, and they’re sharing a special tennis bond as they get closer to Light. He has wild, unrestrained black hair that is still moving very well in some direction. His highlights seem to be beautifully painted and can highlight his childhood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Suzune Horikita (Classroom Of The Elite)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/suzune-horikita.jpg><p>Moving on to our next best black-haired Anime character, Suzune is the principal protagonist in the anime series Classroom Of The Elite with a school system that scrupulously makes students compete. Suzune Horikita is a very kind and gentle girl. She’s friendly, caring, and always considerate. She looks out for everyone’s well-being and is considered a motherly figure by her fellow students. She loves to cook and will make meals for others when they’re feeling under the weather, even if she has a cold or has jacked her cooking skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Mio Akiyama (K-On)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mio-akiyama.jpg><p>So, who tops the list of Best Anime characters with black hairs?? It is none other than <a href=#>guitarist </a>Mio Akiyama from the K-On series. Mio’s favorite instrument of music is the bass guitar. The definition of black is not like Mio Akiyama. She’s introverted, kind, timid, and the hardest K-On character worker. When people slow down and apologize, she hates it. And while she is not the best in communication, she has certain leadership skills since K-On; she keeps everyone organized and focused at the beginning of K-On. No doubt, She is a kind and warm girl, albeit very shy and sensitive. You are going to love her.</p><p><strong>Conclusion!</strong></p><p>Anime is a great genre for any fan and connoisseur.
