Her plan is to fake a conjugal visit with the man who plotted the Dutton’s assassination then kill him.</strong></p><p>Similarly, What is the 6666 Ranch in Yellowstone? The 6666 Ranch isn’t some made-up Hollywood set, it’s a real 266,000-acre operation featured on the popular series “Yellowstone.” That ranch, based near Guthrie, Texas, has sold through United Country Real Estate. No buyer, or price, are available.</p><p>Does Beth get pregnant with Rio’s baby? Clearly, Beth is not actually pregnant and this doctor knew the situation (thanks, Rhea) and lied (which also has us worried for the doctor — if Rio finds out she was in on the scam, he won’t be too happy). Beth thanks the OBGYN and the doctor tells her, “Thank your friend,” with a totally changed demeanor.</p><p>Besides Why does Beth get fired?</p><p>Beth’s bad day continues and she gets fired from Market Equities after Caroline (played by Jacki Weaver, not Sally Struthers like the internet wrongly assumes) accuses her of leaking the police brutality story to the Times.</p><p>Next, Why does John not love Jamie on Yellowstone? For the entire run of the series, all John has done is abuse and manipulate Jamie. He took away his support for Jamie’s run at attorney general and turned him to a pariah on the ranch. Then Jamie became a real pariah after learning John had lied to him his whole life; Jamie was actually adopted—he is not a Dutton.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Taylor_Sheridan_buys_6666_Ranch></span><strong>Did Taylor Sheridan buys 6666 Ranch?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>And now, Sheridan, as a part of the real estate group, has bought the famed Four Sixes Ranch in Texas—a ranch that just happens to be the focus of one of Sheridan’s new shows.
