The series follows the lives of two teenage boys with opposing personalities, Drake Parker (Drake Bell) and Josh Nichols (Josh Peck), who become stepbrothers. Both actors had played previous roles in The Amanda Show along with Nancy Sullivan, who plays Audrey, Drake and Megan’s mother in the series. Miranda Cosgrove plays Megan, Drake’s mischievous younger sister, and Jonathan Goldstein plays Walter, Josh’s father. The series’ opening theme song, “Found a Way”, was written by Drake Bell and Backhouse Mike and performed by Bell. The series is focused on a pair of stepbrothers of opposite personalities. Drake Parker is a popular but immature aspiring musician idolized by his schoolmates and able to court a countless array of beautiful girls with ease, whereas Josh Nichols is a nerdy and eccentric boy with poor luck in dating and popularity. Drake and Josh live in San Diego, California, with their odd, unfortunate, geeky father, a weatherman named Walter; their loving mother Audrey; and their outrageously manipulative and conniving younger sister Megan.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/drake3-1024x683.jpg alt=drake3 width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3><span>Drake and Josh Funny Convos</span></h3><p>28.
